# StateEstimationAV
Autonomous Vehicle State Estimation using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for sensor fusion. Combines IMU, GPS, and LIDAR data to estimate 9-DOF vehicle states (position, velocity, orientation) in real-time. Implements motion prediction, measurement updates, and uncertainty quantification for robust localization.
